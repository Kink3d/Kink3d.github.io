The End of Poly GG
==================

Why? 

I wrote this project as a way for me to learn Ruby On Rails. I successed. I like to learn new programming languages and this was a way for me to step into Ruby and a fun web framework.

Taking A Job At Apple

I am unable to continue to work on this for a few reasons. One being that I now work at Apple and I'm unable to continue development. The source for Poly is on my Github and will always remain there for others to use.

Schools

I had a few schools with Game Development and Web Development courses reach out to me asking if they could use Poly.gg as their internal database for tutorials, example projects and more. I was thrilled at this idea and gave them source. The idea that I created something that students could use to help each other is an amazing feeling. I am thrilled at the thought of 3 schools in the United States using this simple piece of software. 

They mentioned it would be maintained by their web development students and used through the entire school.

Now What? 

Just move on with life :) Until the next project.
